If you use the Anaconda python distribution, you may require the Visual Studio
runtime as a platform-dependent runtime requirement for you package:

```yaml

```


Building the documentation
--------------------------

Documentation for the example project is generated using Sphinx. Sphinx has the
ability to automatically inspect the signatures and documentation strings in
the extension module to generate beautiful documentation in a variety formats.
